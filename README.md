## 🚀 Overview

  

Welcome to **JumbleJobs** — a Tinder-like web application designed to help users find jobs in a simple, swipe-based interface. This proof-of-concept project was built for a Waseda University student’s final year-long course, aiming to showcase a basic yet innovative approach to job searching. The project was developed within a 3-week period the goal was to balance creativity with functionality.

  

## 💡 Inspiration

  

This project was inspired by mobile apps, that simplify complex actions into small, fun, interactions. Tinder’s swipe-based design provided the perfect model to turn job searching into a more interactive and enjoyable experience.

  

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

  

This project uses a minimal yet effective technology stack, ensuring simplicity while maintaining functionality and scalability. 

-  **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3

-  **JS Libraries:** Spline (for 3D interactive elements), Firebase Authentication, Firebase Firestore

-  **Authentication & Data Storage:** Google Firebase (Google OAuth for sign-in, Firebase Firestore for job listings and user data)

-  **Security:** CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing for secure communication with Google API)

-  **Version Control:** GitHub

  

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

  

The design focuses on creating a seamless, intuitive experience for users while incorporating innovative features. A key element of the design is the use of Spline (a 3D modeling tool) for a 3D job interface, providing users with a dynamic visual experience as they browse job listings, enhancing overall user experience.

  

## 🔍 Key Features

  

-  **Swipe-Based Job Searching** – Similar to Tinder’s approach, users can swipe right to like and left to dislike jobs.

-  **3D Interactive Job Interface** – Developed using Spline, adding a visually appealing element to the job search experience.

-  **Google OAuth Authentication** – Secure user authentication through Google, with user data stored in Firebase Firestore.

  

## 🗺️ Project Roadmap

  

This project was primarily a proof-of-concept created for a student's final course project, and although the prototype is fully functional, there is significant potential for further development. If revisited, the following enhancements could be made:

-  **Enhanced Job Filtering & Sorting** – More advanced job search algorithms and filters based on user preferences.

-  **Improved UI/UX** – Additional focus on user experience through more advanced wireframing and prototyping before development.

  

## 📝 Conclusion

  

This project was a highly enjoyable experience, allowing me to explore different technologies like Spline and Firebase in a real-world context. Although built under a deadline, the project was stress-free, and I believe the concept has potential for a succesful future. If I were to work on this again, I would invest more time in planning and prototyping to ensure a smoother development process and better results from the start.
